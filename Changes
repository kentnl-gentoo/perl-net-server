Revision history for Perl extension Net::Server.

0.63  May 07 22:39 2001
        - Updated UDP parameter names.  Names are now
                udp_recv_len (previously udp_packet_size)
                and udp_recv_flags (previously udp_packet_offset).
        - Updated udp_server.pl to use new names.

0.62  May 01 00:44 2001
        - Updated to use getsockopt (determine proto on the fly)
        - Updated perldoc.
        - Added udp_server.pl example.
        - Added UDP_test.t for "make test".
        - Allow customization of udp recv parameters.

0.61  Apr 30 06:32 2001 
        - Sig HUP with UDP now works.
        - Peer info is correctly accessed under UDP
        - Net::Server::INET will not allow one server
                to do both tcp and udp without special
                parameters being passed to the server.
        - Need to make test program for UDP.

0.60  Apr 28 01:56 2001
        - Added support for UDP.  Can now simultaneously accept
                 TCP and UDP.
                Still to do:
                    - allow for SIG HUP under UDP
                    - better determination of peerinfo under UDP
                    - clean up inetd mode.
        - Added restart_close_hook.
        - Added restart_open_hook.
        - Added more documentation (socket access, restarting,
                protocols)

0.59  Apr 24 07:40 2001
        - Forced STDIN,STDOUT,and STDERR to reopen to /dev/null
                if setsid or log_file is set.
                This allows for true daemonization (so
                no output ends up at the terminal).
        - Made appropriate changes in MultiType as well.

0.58  Apr 06 12:29 2001
        - SIG HUP is complete.  Fixed bug in SIG HUP'ing 
                PreFork mode.  Now effectively restarts.
        - Various clean ups in code.
        - More unification of code.

0.57  Mar 29 01:36 2001
        - SIG HUP is now functional on multiport mode under
                Single and Fork Mode.  No functionality is
                lost under PreFork, but HUP'ing results in
                seg fault.
        - Various bug fixes.

0.56  Mar 20 12:34 2001
        - Catch SIG pipes
        - Clean up of existing signal handling.
        - Trim memory in PreFork

0.55  Mar 19 10:44 2001
        - Allow overwrite of pid file - safe as other user.
        - More unified Signal handling, removal of duplicate code.
        - Allow Fork Server to shutdown the socket immediately
                after client accept to allow parent to HUP more
                 easily.
        - Check to see if parent process is still around in PreFork
                Server.  (Don't keep running if parent was
                 "kill 9"ed.)
        - Save commandline parameters in preparation for HUP

0.54  Mar 16 12:47 2001
        - Better handling of sigs in prefork
        - Improved logic on child coordination routine
        - Added parent_read_hook
        - Added httpd example
        - Added LoadTester.pl example

0.53  Mar 14 01:13 2001
        - Allow host to be set to '*'
                Allows for the server to bind to port whatever
                on all addresses at that box.
        - Make passing of host and proto on command line
                taint clean.
        - Added setsid functionality.
        - Added syslog_facility option - default is daemon.
        - Changed Fork and PreFork to handle $SIG{CHLD} in
                a more reliable fashion.
        - Added parent_read_hook

0.52  Mar 13 01:16 2001
        - Added syslog ability.
                This allows for logging to syslog instead
                of STDERR or a log file.  Logging still
                takes place via $self->log() but is configurable
                at startup.
        - Standardized existing log numbers to match syslog levels.

0.51  Mar 10 16:35 2001
        - Added piped serialization option.
                This allows for serialization to be done on
                a wider range of machines.  Flock is more
                bulletproof, but pipe is more portable.
                See the Net::Server::PreFork manpage.

0.50  Mar 10 10:06 2001
        - Added serialize option to PreFork.
                This allows for serialization to be turned on
                even on non_multi port process - this is
                done to get around some OS's which don't 
                allow children to accept on the same socket
                at the same time.
        - Added semaphore type to the serialize option
                This type uses IPC::Semaphore instead of flock
                to serialize the child accept sequence.
                Thanks to Bennett Todd for sample code.

0.48  Mar 08 23:57 2001
        - Catch $SIG{INT}, $SIG{TERM} and $SIG{QUIT} in PreFork and Fork.
                This allows parent to shutdown children properly.
        - Catch $SIG{HUP} (currently shuts down server, needs to
                be able to restart server re-reading conf file)
        - Changed pid_file creation to after chroot, change of group
                and change of user - making sure the server has 
                permission to write out the pid file.
        - Remove use of "use subs" in PreFork.

0.47  Mar 08 07:03 2001
        - Fix reverse lookup bug - thanks to Jonathan J. Miner for 
                pointing out the missing pieces.
        - Cleaned up pod examples
        - Clarified some of the pod

0.46  Mar 05 07:37 2001
	- secure removal of pid_file - only happens on success -
                possibly should only happen after process has become
                another user
        - secure removal of lock_file - only happens if we generated it
        - added child_init_hook and child_finish_hook to PreFork
        - changed pre_configure_hook to configure_hook
        - added simple httpd example script

0.45  Mar 02 00:44 2001
	- clean up make process.
        - change version to hard coded number.
        - improve testing scripts

0.44  Mar 01 00:55 2001
	- partitioned properties in single hashref value.
        - changed versioning system to use cvs revision.
        - general clean up and add documentation.

0.43  Feb 28 01:08 2001
	- this revision and last add bulk of documentation.
        -various clean ups

0.4.1  Feb 26 17:48 2001
        - first build.  Up to this point many revisions, bug fixes
                and optimizations had been made.

0.1.0  Feb 08 06:28 2001
        - first cvs check in.  Up to this point, much thought and
                research had gone into the server.
