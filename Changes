Revision history for Perl extension Net::Server.

0.51  Mar 13 01:16 2001
        - Added syslog ability.
                This allows for logging to syslog instead
                of STDERR or a log file.  Logging still
                takes place via $self->log() but is configurable
                at startup.
        - Standardized existing log numbers to match syslog levels.

0.51  Mar 10 16:35 2001
        - Added piped serialization option.
                This allows for serialization to be done on
                a wider range of machines.  Flock is more
                bulletproof, but pipe is more portable.
                See the Net::Server::PreFork manpage.

0.50  Mar 10 10:06 2001
        - Added serialize option to PreFork.
                This allows for serialization to be turned on
                even on non_multi port process - this is
                done to get around some OS's which don't 
                allow children to accept on the same socket
                at the same time.
        - Added semaphore type to the serialize option
                This type uses IPC::Semaphore instead of flock
                to serialize the child accept sequence.
                Thanks to Bennett Todd for sample code.

0.48  Mar 08 23:57 2001
        - Catch $SIG{INT}, $SIG{TERM} and $SIG{QUIT} in PreFork and Fork.
                This allows parent to shutdown children properly.
        - Catch $SIG{HUP} (currently shuts down server, needs to
                be able to restart server re-reading conf file)
        - Changed pid_file creation to after chroot, change of group
                and change of user - making sure the server has 
                permission to write out the pid file.
        - Remove use of "use subs" in PreFork.

0.47  Mar 08 07:03 2001
        - Fix reverse lookup bug - thanks to Jonathan J. Miner for 
                pointing out the missing pieces.
        - Cleaned up pod examples
        - Clarified some of the pod

0.46  Mar 05 07:37 2001
	- secure removal of pid_file - only happens on success -
                possibly should only happen after process has become
                another user
        - secure removal of lock_file - only happens if we generated it
        - added child_init_hook and child_finish_hook to PreFork
        - changed pre_configure_hook to configure_hook
        - added simple httpd example script
